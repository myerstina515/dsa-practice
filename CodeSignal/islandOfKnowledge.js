// isIPv4Address
// An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.
// Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.
// An identification number for devices connected to the internet. An IPv4 addresses written in dotted quad notation consists of four 8-bit integers separated by periods.
// In other words, it's a string of four numbers each between 0 and 255 inclusive, with a "." character in between each number. All numbers should be present without leading zeros.

// Examples:

// 192.168.0.1 is a valid IPv4 address
// 255.255.255.255 is a valid IPv4 address
// 280.100.92.101 is not a valid IPv4 address because 280 is too large to be an 8-bit integer (the largest 8-bit integer is 255)
// 255.100.81.160.172 is not a valid IPv4 address because it contains 5 integers instead of 4
// 1..0.1 is not a valid IPv4 address because it's not properly formatted
// 17.233.00.131 and 17.233.01.131 are not valid IPv4 addresses because they contain leading zeros
